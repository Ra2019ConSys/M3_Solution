Darker cuts like the thigh and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat.

If you’re switching out red meat for chicken, you’ll want to stick with chicken breast, as it’s the healthiest cut of the bird.

  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"><div class="bod"><p id="Beef">Beef</p><p class="bg_tex">A staple at the Australian dinner table and on our barbecues, beef is an excellent source of the nutrients our bodies need to function properly – particularly Australian beef, which is predominantly grass-fed and lean. (To reduce the saturated fat content, you can trim the fat off the edges before you throw it on the grill.)

The Australian Dietary Guidelines recommend eating red meat, which includes our beloved beef – as well as lamb, pork, veal, goat and kangaroo – because it’s a great source of protein, iron and zinc. But, like all good things, moderation is the key.</p></div></div>

As if you needed more reasons to love sushi, today you’re going to learn 5 benefits of sushi that will make you fall 5 times more in love. Sushi is super healthy for you in more ways than one. Get out your chopsticks and keep reading.

Before the sushi craze hit American shores, sushi actually first began in Southeast Asia before spreading to China and then hitting Japan around the 8th century. This was all thanks to a simple dish where fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice. It was not until Japan, however, when they started eating the fermented rice along with the fish, and that’s when the sushi, that we all know and love, was born. Humble beginnings for an amazing food that we just can’t get enough of, and thank goodness for that because there’s so much goodness in sushi.</p></div></div>
